# Memory-Game
A fun memory card made by our group, built with HTML , CSS and JavaScript.
## Instructions:
The user should flip two cards and look for a match.  
If both cards contain the same image, the cards should dissapear.  
If the cards don't contain the same image, cards will flip again to their back side.  
There is a count for wrong and right geusses and a timer which stops counting seconds when the user wins the game.
## Our way of solving this game together
We all took a part of building this game. Each of us did another part of the game and we discussed and planned it by several zoom meetings.  
## Methods were used to implement the game
We needed to implement several functions such as :  
A function that shuffle the cards randomaly each time the game starts and a function that set them automatically to the board.  
The main game function which decide what to do wether the user flipped 2 cards with identical image or not.  
A pause function which make a suspantion time when cards are flipped so the user can't flip other cards during that time. 
A timer function.  
We also used setTimeOut and SetInterval functions and added animations to some parts of the games.
